# HOW-TO
```
git clone https://github.com/jakobod/modelsim-installer
cd modelsim-installer
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
after those commands you should be able to find modelsim in your desktop icons

# Notes
This has only been tested on Fedora with gnome. Other Distros and desktop-environments will probably work, but may need some changes in the scripts.
